Smith is a simple terminal-based text editor written in Rust.

Featuring:

* line numbers
* undo/redo
* standard keybindings (Ctrl-S, Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-C...)
* mouse support
* clipboard support

Here's what it looks like editing its own source code:

With more planned such as syntax highlighting, user configurations, search & replace, persistent undo, etc.
